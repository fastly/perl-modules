This is the Net::IP module, designed to allow easy manipulation of IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses.

You need to have Math::BigInt installed on your system.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

There is also a small application which uses the IP.pm module: ipcount.pl.
Basically, it's an IP address mini-calculator, it can calculate the number of
IP addresses in a prefix or all the prefixes contained in a given range.

All bug reports and suggestions for improvemenets should be sent to
